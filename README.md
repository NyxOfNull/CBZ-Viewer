## üöÄ Getting Started (Offline Setup)

Because this application uses utility classes for styling, it requires the **Tailwind CSS framework**. To ensure it works without an internet connection, you need to provide the CSS file locally.

### 1. Download the Dependencies

This project relies on three key files to function:

- `index.html` (The main application code)  
- `jszip.min.js` (Library for reading the `.cbz` zip archives)  
- `tailwind.min.css` (The full, compiled CSS framework)  

**Action Required:**  
You must manually download the full, minified version of the Tailwind CSS stylesheet and JSZip, and place them into their respective folders.

**Download Tailwind CSS:** Copy the content of a stable Tailwind CSS CDN link (e.g., Tailwind v2.2.19 CDN) or a similar static link.

**Organize Folders & Files:**

1. Create a subfolder named `CSS`.  
2. Save the Tailwind content into a new file named `tailwind.min.css` inside the `CSS` folder.  
3. Create a subfolder named `JS`.  
4. Place the `jszip.min.js` file inside the `JS` folder.  

Your final directory structure should look like this:

<pre> ``` 
  /Your-Project-Folder 
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html 
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CSS 
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tailwind.min.css
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ JS 
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ jszip.min.js ``` </pre>


### 2. Run the Viewer

Simply **double-click the `index.html`** file to open the application in your web browser (Chrome or Firefox are recommended).

## üìñ Usage Instructions

### Loading Your Comics

1. Click the **"Select Folder Containing CBZ Files"** button.  
2. In the file explorer dialog, navigate to and select the folder that contains your `.cbz` and/or `.cbr` files.  
3. The application will automatically read the folder contents, sort the files, and load the first detected comic book.  

### Navigation

The application uses the file structure of your selected folder for navigation:

- **Chapter Dropdown (Top & Bottom):** Use the dropdown menu to quickly switch to any other CBZ file in the folder by name.  
- **"PREV CBZ" / "NEXT CBZ" Buttons:** Use these buttons at the bottom to sequentially move between the loaded comic archives.  

### Zoom Controls

- Use the **+** and **-** buttons located in the bottom-left corner to adjust the zoom level of the entire long-strip view.  
- The application automatically adjusts the scrolling area to match the scaled content, ensuring smooth, natural page scrolling.

| Dependency   | Purpose                                                                                          | Source Location         |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Tailwind CSS | Styling and responsive design utilities.                                                        | Local: CSS/tailwind.min.css |
| JSZip       | Decompressing and reading the contents of `.cbz` (zip) archives.                                | Local: JS/jszip.min.js |
| CBZ Support | Files are read from the local file system using the experimental `webkitdirectory` attribute on the file input. | N/A                    |
| CBR Support | Currently, `.cbr` (RAR) files are recognized but require the underlying JSZip library to support RAR format, which it generally does not natively. They are filtered alongside `.cbz` but may not load correctly without a custom RAR decompressor. | N/A                    |
